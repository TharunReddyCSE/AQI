# AQI
## Air Quality Index project

The Air Quality Index or AQI, is used to provide the latest air quality information for any city or geographic location in the world. The AQI tracks ozone (smog) and particle pollution (tiny particles from ash, power plants and factories, vehicle exhaust, soil dust, pollen, and other pollution), as well as four other widespread air pollutants.
