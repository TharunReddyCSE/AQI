# AQI
## Air Quality Index project

The Air Quality Index, or AQI, is the system used to warn the public when air pollution is dangerous. It provides the latest air quality information for any city or geographic location in the world. The AQI tracks ozone (smog) and particle pollution (tiny particles from ash, power plants and factories, vehicle exhaust, soil dust, pollen, and other pollution), as well as four other widespread air pollutants.
